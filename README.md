# Harmful Object Detection Webapp using Deep Learning and HTML-Flask.

### This webapp is a Deep Learning-based real-time harmful object detector.
### The webapp and frontend are done in HTML-CSS and Python Flask.
### YOLOv5 model is used as the detector here.
### YOLOV5 is trained with harmful objects such as Gun, Knife, Hammer and Fire and Smoke are added additionally.
### The webapp has features for real-time detection from webcam feed and additional functionality to search a particular harmful object in an uploaded video. 
### Image data of Gun and other objects are collected and annotated using the Roboflow platform to prepare the dataset to train YOLOV5.
### Training proccess are given in the colab notebooks 'Part_1_YOLO_Training.ipynb' and 'Part_2_Test_model.ipynb' - Both of them can be opened in the Google Colab IDE.
### Some results are given in the folder.
### Some test videos, a PPT, dataset used to train YOLOv5, and the final trained models can be found in https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1ewQoQQEftmmL66zOfSsGDl4A5zcs_Co1
